                <p>Designed and built a Telemetry subsystem using an Arduino R3 and computes data such as Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, UTC time for scheduling, Earthâ€™s magnetic field and frequency and amplitude of vibrations (Full Report on GitHub). Developed on Arduino IDE (very similar to C++ with exceptions on compilation and running)</p>

                </div>
                <p>Built a 3D model of the solar system on a 1:10 scale (time and space, so for example Saturn would need around 2.95 years to complete a full orbit in the simulator), simulating the orbit of the planets, by modeling with Blender and building it with Unreal Engine 5. Could possibly develop into a full scale project to be released as a free learning tool for all.</p>

                <p> Space Index is a website I developed, that acts as an e-learning platform, to learn about our solar system, as well as some important man made-objects that were dpeloyed and sent to space (and some still active to this day). It's built using vanilla web dev tools such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript</p>

                <p> Quasar is an astronomy essay generator. It's a simple and straightforward generator that uses OpenAI's API and the GPT 3.5 model data to get accurate information, and generate proper essays (NB: If you want to implement it, you do need your own OpenAI API key as I do not provide it for obvious security reasons). Made on python.</p>
